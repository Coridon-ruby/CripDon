# FS Ransomware Demonstrator

## Description
This project is an educational demonstration of ransomware written in Python. It was developed for the purpose of learning and understanding the basic mechanisms that ransomware can utilize. **This software is only for use in controlled environments and should not be used for illegal activities.**

## Features
- **Robust Encryption**: Implements 3 stable encryption algorithms. Without the correct key, the encrypted files cannot be decrypted.
- **Custom File Extension**: Adds the `.FS` extension to all encrypted files.
- **Intelligent File Selection**: Encrypts all files except those that can damage the system, such as `.htaccess`.
- **Custom Messages**: Allows users to write a personalized message that will be displayed on the ransom screen.
- **Backdoor**: Generates a backdoor and inserts it into all files with `.php` and `.html` extensions.
- **Web Shell**: Loads a web shell for remote control.
- **Python Encryptor with Data Collection**: Generates an encryptor that collects information about the infected device and executes commands via PowerShell.
- **Deface Main Page**: Replaces the main page of the website with one defined by the ransomware operator.
